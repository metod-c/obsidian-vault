# Nice-to-have epic
Nice to have epic has become bloated over the years. In 2026 I would like to have this epic cleaned by:
- [ ]  Cancel the tickets that are either duplicated, no longer applicable or possibly have been implemented.
- [ ] Implement those which actually improve usability of our solutions. This should be low priority, but I we should strive each developer implements 2-3 minor improvements per Q. The total amount of work should not be more that 2 days.
